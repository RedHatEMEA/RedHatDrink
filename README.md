Invented by Goerkem Harp from G-Cocktails http://www.g-cocktails.de

* Fill a huge glas (Hurricane) with ice to let it cool down
* Put one ice shovel into the larger part of your cocktail shaker and put the smaller part into the other
* Pour all listed ingredients into it:

- 4cl Vodka
- 2cl Triple Sec
- 2cl Lime juice
- 2cl Lime Cordial
- 4cl Blackberry puree
- 2cl Grenadine syrup

* Use the strainer to remove the water from the ice, put the remaining ice into the other part of the cocktail shaker, close it and shake for 15 seconds
